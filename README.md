# CaptainConsole

Introduction:
This is a school project by Bergþóra Ólöf Björgvinsdóttir, Lilja Ýr Guðmundsdóttir, Matthildur Fríða Gunnarsdóttir, and Svava Ósk Árnadóttir. The goal was to make a fully functioning website for a gaming store called Captain Console where games and consoles could be browsed and bought.

How to run:
In order to run the program you need to place the first CaptainConnsole (with two n's) as the root folder. This is where you also should be located in the terminal when starting up the virtual environment (Mac: source ./venv/bin/activate , Windows: venv\Scripts\activate) and then use python "manage.py runserver" (or "./manage.py runserver") (if running on Mac then add "8000" to the end of that command)
You also need to run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in order to get the correct versions of everything we installed.
